LinearProbing

Linear probing is a technique used in computer science for resolving collisions in hash tables. A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs, and a hash function is used to map keys to indices in an array. However, collisions can occur when two keys hash to the same index.

In linear probing, when a collision occurs, the algorithm looks for the next available slot in the array by probing linearly until an empty slot is found. If the next slot is occupied, the algorithm continues searching for the next available slot until an empty one is found.
